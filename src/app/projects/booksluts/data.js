        overview: "A book club with as much sass as the characters in the books we read. In 2020, my friends and I started a book club as a coping mechanism during the pandemic, and to our surprise, it has not only endured over three years but continues to thrive.",
        strategy: [
            "I wanted the brand to be bold and memorable, while also conveying a sense of inclusivity, and community. I drew inspiration from the club's contemporary book selection and created a visual language that with as much sass as the characters in the books we read.",
            "The web design experience for the website is heavily inspired by print magazines and editorial design. The large contrasting type, big use of white space, horizontal scroll and bold colours are all characteristics I was inspired by when designing the site."
        ],
        experience: "One of my goals was to develop a unique experience that was delightful to use and encouraged readers to swipe to learn more. In addition to that I also wanted to try out different libraries and expand my development skills. In this project Iâ€™m using GSAP for animation tweens and timelines, Locomotive Scroll to handle the page scrolling and parallax, and  BarbaJS to handle the page transitions."
